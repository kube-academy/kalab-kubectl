Remember we wanted to list the Pods in the previous steps, but there were not any deployed in the `default` Namespace? We now have Pods in the `default` Namespace from when we created that Deployment resource.

```terminal:execute
command: kubectl get pods
```

Run the command until the pods are *Running* condition
