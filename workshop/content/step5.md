Your dedicated namespace for this session is {{session_namespace}}.

The following command will list all pods in that namespace:

```terminal:execute
command: kubectl get pods
```

Currently, no Pods are deployed to that namespace.

**Pro Tip**:
`kubectl get po` is a shortened version of the command above.
